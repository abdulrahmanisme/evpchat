## 📊 **GPA Calculation Formula**

### **Weighted GPA Components:**
```
Weighted GPA = (Average Effort Score × 0.4) + 
               (Average Quality Score × 0.4) + 
               (Credit Bonus × 0.2)

Where Credit Bonus = min(Total Credits / 10, 2.0)
```

### **Scoring Criteria:**
- **Effort Score (0-10):** Initiative, dedication, proactivity
- **Quality Score (0-10):** Thoughtfulness, specificity, insightfulness
- **Credit Value:** Based on reflection completeness and depth
