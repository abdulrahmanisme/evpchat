## ðŸ§  **Gemini AI Features**

### **Intelligent Analysis:**
- âœ… **Context-aware** understanding of each core principle
- âœ… **Nuanced scoring** based on reflection quality and depth
- âœ… **Parameter-specific** evaluation for each principle
- âœ… **Consistent JSON output** format as specified

### **Smart Prompting:**
```typescript
// Example prompt for Innovation principle
const prompt = `You are an AI assistant helping Campus Leads submit structured reflections for their events.

**Core Principle:** Innovation
**Credit Value:** 2
**Evaluation Parameters:** creativity, problem-solving

**Campus Lead Reflection:**
1. Highlights: "Created innovative coding challenges..."
2. Challenges: "Faced technical difficulties but learned to troubleshoot..."

**Instructions:**
- Analyze the reflection for effort, impact, and learning
- Score each dimension from 0-5
- Generate parameter scores (1-10) based on creativity and problem-solving
- Calculate growth grade (0-10) based on overall performance
- Provide a concise 1-2 line summary

**Required JSON Output Format:**
{
  "reflection": {
    "highlights": "Created innovative coding challenges...",
    "challenges": "Faced technical difficulties but learned to troubleshoot..."
  },
  "credit_suggestion": {
    "effort": <0-5>,
    "impact": <0-5>,
    "learning": <0-5>,
    "total": <sum>
  },
  "summary": "<1-2 line summary>",
  "growth_grade": <0-10>,
  "parameter_scores": {
    "creativity": <1-10>,
    "problem_solving": <1-10>
  }
}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no additional text.`
```

### **Robust Error Handling:**
- âœ… **API key validation** with fallback to rule-based system
- âœ… **Response parsing** with JSON extraction and validation
- âœ… **Score bounds checking** (0-5 for credits, 1-10 for parameters)
- âœ… **Graceful degradation** if Gemini is unavailable

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Gemini Output**

### **Sample Input:**
```
Highlights: "Organized a successful campus hackathon with 75 participants. Created innovative coding challenges and managed logistics effectively."
