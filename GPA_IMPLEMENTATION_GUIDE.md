# GPA System Implementation Guide

## ðŸš€ **Quick Setup Steps**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250123000003_gpa_evaluation_system.sql`
3. Execute the migration
4. Verify the new tables are created:
   - `core_principles`
   - `growth_evaluations` 
   - `attendance`

### **Step 2: Verify TypeScript Types**
The types have been updated in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` to include:
- New table definitions
- Updated `profiles` table with GPA fields
- Proper relationships and constraints

### **Step 3: Test the System**

#### **For Students:**
1. Go to `/dashboard`
2. Switch to "GPA System" tab
3. Submit a growth evaluation:
   - Select a core principle
   - Rate effort (1-5 stars)
   - Write a reflection
   - Submit for review
4. Record attendance:
   - Fill in event details
   - Select event type
   - Submit attendance record

#### **For Admins:**
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Navigate to "GPA Evaluations" tab
3. Review submitted evaluations:
   - Read student reflections
   - Verify or reject submissions
   - Add admin comments
4. Check "GPA Leaderboard" tab for rankings

#### **For Superadmins:**
1. Go to `/superadmin`
2. Access all GPA management features
3. Full oversight of the evaluation system

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Principles Pre-loaded**

The system comes with 5 core principles already configured:

1. **Ownership** - Taking responsibility and initiative
2. **Innovation** - Bringing creative solutions and new ideas  
3. **Collaboration** - Working effectively with others
4. **Excellence** - Maintaining high standards and continuous improvement
5. **Impact** - Creating meaningful change and measurable results

Each principle has:
- 100 max credits
- Weight of 1.00 in GPA calculation
- Specific parameters for evaluation

## ðŸ“Š **GPA Calculation**

### **How it Works:**
- **Effort Score (1-5)** â†’ **Credits Earned**
  - 1 = 0% credits
  - 2 = 25% credits  
  - 3 = 50% credits
  - 4 = 75% credits
  - 5 = 100% credits

- **GPA Formula**: `(Total Weighted Credits / Total Max Weighted Credits) Ã— 4.00`

### **Attendance Credits:**
- **Event**: 1 credit
- **Meeting**: 2 credits
- **Workshop**: 3 credits
- **Training**: 5 credits

## ðŸ”„ **Workflow**
