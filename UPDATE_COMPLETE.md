# ✅ Codebase Updated to 2-Metric System

## What Changed

The Edge Function has been updated to evaluate reflections using **only 2 metrics: Effort and Quality**.

### Files Modified

1. **`supabase/functions/evaluate-reflection/index.ts`**
   - Removed Depth and Scale scores
   - Updated to evaluate only Effort and Quality
   - Updated validation to check only 2 metrics
   - Updated fallback evaluation to include only 2 metrics

2. **`supabase/functions/evaluate-reflection/index-simple.ts`**
   - Created simplified version (reference)

## Evaluation Metrics

### ✅ Effort Score (0-10)
- Initiative, frequency, persistence, and dedication shown
- Did the campus lead show initiative and proactivity?
- Is there evidence of consistent effort and persistence?
- Did they go above basic requirements?

### ✅ Quality Score (0-10)
- Measurable outcomes, effectiveness, and clarity
- Are there specific, quantifiable results mentioned?
- Is the response clear, well-structured, and professional?
- Does it demonstrate effectiveness and impact?

### ❌ Removed Metrics
- **Depth Score** - No longer evaluated
- **Scale Score** - No longer evaluated

## What Happens Now

1. **Campus Lead submits reflection** → Stored in database
2. **Edge Function triggered** → Calls Gemini AI
3. **AI evaluates** on 2 metrics (Effort & Quality) → Returns scores
4. **Scores saved** to `reflections` table (only effort_score and quality_score)
5. **GPA calculated** automatically

---

## Database Changes

The following columns in the `reflections` table are **NOT** updated anymore:
- `depth_score` - Remains NULL
- `scale_score` - Remains NULL

Only these columns are updated:
- ✅ `effort_score`
- ✅ `quality_score`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the updated function** to Supabase (via Dashboard)
2. **Test with a new reflection** submission
3. **Verify only 2 scores** are returned

---

## Status

✅ **Codebase Updated** - Ready for deployment
