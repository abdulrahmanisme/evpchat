# 📅 Event Integration - Admin/SuperAdmin to Campus Leads

## Overview

---

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. Database Integration

**New Events Table** (`supabase/migrations/20250128000004_create_events_table.sql`):
- `id` - UUID primary key
- `title` - Event title
- `date` - Event date
- `time` - Event time
- `location` - Event location
- `type` - Event type (meeting, workshop, event)
- `description` - Event description
- `created_by` - Admin/SuperAdmin user ID
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

**RLS Policies**:
- ✅ Admins/SuperAdmins can manage all events
- ✅ Campus Leads can view all events

### 2. Admin Event Management

**Updated** (`src/components/admin/AdminEventManagement.tsx`):
- ✅ Real database operations (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Events saved to `events` table
- ✅ Automatic refresh after changes
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback

### 3. SuperAdmin Event Management

**Updated** (`src/components/superadmin/SuperAdminEventManagement.tsx`):
- ✅ Real database operations
- ✅ Enhanced stats dashboard
- ✅ Shows who created each event
- ✅ System-wide event management

### 4. Campus Leads Calendar

**Updated** (`src/components/calendar/CalendarModal.tsx`):
- ✅ Fetches events from database
- ✅ Shows all events created by admins/superadmins
- ✅ Real-time event display
- ✅ Fallback to sample data if database fails

## 🔄 How It Works
