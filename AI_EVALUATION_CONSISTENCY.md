# ðŸ¤– AI Evaluation Consistency Guide

## âœ… Improvements Made for Consistent Evaluation

### 1. Clear Scoring Guidelines

Added specific score ranges with descriptions:

**Effort Score:**
- **0-3**: Little or no initiative
- **4-5**: Basic effort, meets minimal requirements
- **6-7**: Good initiative and persistence
- **8-9**: Excellent effort, proactive
- **10**: Outstanding, consistently goes above and beyond

**Quality Score:**
- **0-3**: No measurable outcomes, unclear
- **4-5**: Some results but vague
- **6-7**: Clear outcomes with some evidence
- **8-9**: Well-structured with specific results
- **10**: Exceptional with detailed measurable outcomes

### 2. Key Factors Defined

**For Effort:**
- Initiative: Taking the lead vs waiting
- Frequency: How often they engaged
- Persistence: Overcoming challenges
- Dedication: Going above requirements

**For Quality:**
- Measurable outcomes: Specific numbers/metrics
- Clarity: Well-structured and professional
- Effectiveness: Achieving intended impact
- Evidence: Concrete examples

### 3. Scoring Rules Added

1. âœ… **Be Consistent** - Similar responses = similar scores
2. âœ… **Cite Specific Examples** - Reference actual content
3. âœ… **Use Full Scale** - Don't cluster around 5-7
4. âœ… **Penalize Vagueness** - Lower scores for unclear responses
5. âœ… **Reward Specificity** - Higher scores for quantifiable results

## How Consistency is Ensured

### Temperature Setting
- **Temperature: 0.3** (Low randomness)
- Ensures similar responses get similar scores
- Reduces variability between evaluations

### Prompt Structure
- Clear rubric with score ranges
- Specific questions to consider
- Explicit scoring rules
- Emphasis on consistency in instructions

### Response Validation
- Validates scores are numbers
- Ensures scores are within 0-10 range
- Fallback evaluation available if API fails

## Expected Behavior

### âœ… Consistent Evaluation Example

**Response A**: "I helped organize an event with my team. We had 50 participants and raised $500 for charity."
- Effort: 7-8 (Good initiative, specific example)
- Quality: 8 (Clear measurable results)

**Response B**: "I organized a campus event with my team. We got about 50 people to attend and raised some money."
- Effort: 6-7 (Good initiative but less specific)
- Quality: 7 (Some quantifiable results)

Both are similar but Response A scores slightly higher due to specificity.

## Testing Consistency

To verify consistency:

1. **Submit multiple similar quality responses**
2. **Compare scores** - they should be within 1-2 points
3. **Check patterns** - vague responses should score lower
4. **Verify scale usage** - don't see clustering at 5-7

## Status

âœ… **Prompt Updated** - Better consistency guidelines
âœ… **Clear Rubric** - Specific score ranges defined
âœ… **Scoring Rules** - Explicit instructions for consistency
âœ… **Low Temperature** - Reduced randomness in scoring

**Ready for deployment!**
