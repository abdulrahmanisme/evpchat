# ü§ñ AI-Powered Reflection Analysis System

## üéØ **What's Been Created**

### **1. Supabase Edge Function**
- `supabase/functions/evaluateReflection/index.ts`
- **AI-powered analysis** of campus lead reflections
- **Automatic credit suggestions** based on effort, impact, and learning
- **Parameter scoring** for each core principle
- **Growth grade calculation** (0-10 scale)

### **2. Frontend Component**
- `src/components/gpa/AIReflectionForm.tsx`
- **Structured input form** with the 2 key questions
- **Real-time AI analysis** display
- **Credit suggestions** and growth grade
- **Parameter scores** breakdown

## üß† **AI Analysis Logic**

### **Input Questions (Exactly as Specified):**
1. **What were the key highlights or wins from your event this week?**
2. **What challenges or learnings did you face, and how did you address them?**

### **AI Output Format:**
```json
{
  "reflection": {
    "highlights": "<Campus Lead answer to Q1>",
    "challenges": "<Campus Lead answer to Q2>"
  },
  "credit_suggestion": {
    "effort": "<0-5>",
    "impact": "<0-5>", 
    "learning": "<0-5>",
    "total": "<sum>"
  },
  "summary": "<1-2 line summary>",
  "growth_grade": "<0-10>",
  "parameter_scores": {
    "<parameter_name>": "<1-10>"
  }
}
```

## üîß **Analysis Algorithms**

### **Effort Analysis (0-5):**
- **Action words**: organized, created, implemented, led, managed
- **Detail level**: Word count and specificity
- **Accountability**: Use of "I" statements and ownership

### **Impact Analysis (0-5):**
- **Measurable outcomes**: Numbers and metrics
- **Reach indicators**: team, students, community, campus
- **Positive outcomes**: successful, achieved, improved

### **Learning Analysis (0-5):**
- **Reflection depth**: learned, realized, understood, discovered
- **Problem-solving**: addressed, solved, overcame, improved
- **Growth mindset**: "next time", "future", "improve"

### **Parameter Scoring (1-10):**
- **Principle-specific** analysis based on core principle parameters
- **Creativity**: innovative, unique, original, new ideas
- **Collaboration**: team, together, collaborated, partnered
- **Ownership**: effort, accountability, initiative

## üöÄ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Deploy Edge Function**
```bash
# In your project root
supabase functions deploy evaluateReflection
```

### **Step 2: Test the Function**
```bash
# Test locally
supabase functions serve evaluateReflection

# Test with sample data
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/evaluateReflection' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "highlights": "Organized a successful campus event with 50+ participants",
    "challenges": "Faced technical difficulties but learned to troubleshoot and adapt",
    "principle_id": "principle-uuid",
    "user_id": "user-uuid"
  }'
```

### **Step 3: Integrate Frontend**
```tsx
// In your Dashboard component
import { AIReflectionForm } from "@/components/gpa/AIReflectionForm";

// Replace existing form with:
<AIReflectionForm onSuccess={() => {
  // Reload GPA data
  loadGPAData();
}} />
```

## üé® **User Experience Flow**

### **For Campus Leads:**
1. **Select Core Principle** from dropdown
2. **Answer 2 Questions**:
   - Key highlights/wins
   - Challenges and learnings
3. **Submit & Analyze** - AI processes reflection
4. **View Results**:
   - Credit suggestions (effort, impact, learning)
   - Growth grade (0-10)
   - Parameter scores
   - AI summary
5. **Automatic Submission** to database

### **For Admins:**
- **View all reflections** with AI analysis
- **Verify/reject** submissions
- **See AI summaries** for quick review
- **GPA updates** automatically
