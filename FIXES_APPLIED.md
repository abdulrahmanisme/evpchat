# Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Date Range Error (2025-10-32)**
**Problem:** The code was using `-32` as the last day of the month, which doesn't exist for any month.

**Fix Applied:** Now calculates the actual last day of the selected month dynamically.
- Modified: `src/components/admin/AdminOfficeAttendance.tsx`
- Changed: `lt('check_date', ${selectedMonth}-32)` to proper date calculation
- Now uses: `lte('check_date', endDate)` where endDate is the actual last day of the month

### 2. **Missing attendance_settings Table**
**Problem:** The migration hasn't been run yet, causing the table to not exist.

**Fix Applied:** Added graceful error handling that defaults to allowing updates when table doesn't exist.
- Modified: `src/components/admin/AttendanceSettings.tsx`
- Modified: `src/components/calendar/CalendarModal.tsx`
- Behavior: If table doesn't exist, defaults to allowing updates
- Auto-creates: Settings will be created automatically when first toggled

## Migration Files to Run

You need to apply these migrations to your Supabase database:

1. `supabase/migrations/20250129000001_create_office_attendance.sql`
2. `supabase/migrations/20250129000002_add_attendance_settings.sql`

### How to Apply Migrations:

**Option 1: Using Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

**Option 2: Manual Application**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and run the SQL from both migration files

**Option 3: Using Supabase Migration Tool**
```bash
# If using Supabase locally
supabase migration up

# If deploying to Supabase cloud
supabase db push
```
