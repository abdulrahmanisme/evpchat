# ⚠️ Rate Limit Fix Applied

## Problem

The Gemini API free tier has strict rate limits:
- **10 requests per minute**
- Error: `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`

## Solution Applied

### ✅ Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

The Edge Function now includes:

1. **Automatic Retries**: Up to 3 retry attempts
2. **Exponential Backoff**: 2s → 4s → 8s delays
3. **Rate Limit Handling**: Specifically handles 429 errors

### How It Works

```typescript
// When rate limit is hit:
1. Wait 2 seconds
2. Retry request
3. If still rate limited:
   - Wait 4 seconds
   - Retry again
4. If still rate limited:
   - Wait 8 seconds  
   - Retry one last time
5. If still failing → Use fallback evaluation
```

## What Happens Now

### ✅ Scenario 1: Rate Limit Hit (Temporary)
- Function waits and retries automatically
- User doesn't see an error
- Success rate: **High**

### ⚠️ Scenario 2: Continuous Rate Limiting
- After 3 retries, uses fallback evaluation
- Reflection is still recorded
- User sees: "AI evaluation failed, will be reviewed manually"
- Scores: Basic scores based on text analysis

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Wait It Out (Free Tier)
- Wait 1 minute between batches of reflections
- Limit submissions to 10 per minute

### Option 2: Upgrade Gemini Plan
- Go to: https://ai.google.dev/pricing
- Upgrade to paid tier for higher limits

### Option 3: Add Manual Queuing
- Queue reflections instead of processing immediately
- Process them with delays between each

---

## Status

✅ **Retry Logic Implemented** - Handles rate limits gracefully

---

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. Submit a reflection that triggers rate limit
2. Check function logs for retry attempts
3. Verify fallback evaluation is used if all retries fail
