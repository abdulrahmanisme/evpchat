## 🎯 How It Works

### User Interaction:
1. **User clicks** on any event badge in the calendar
2. **Dialog appears** positioned above the clicked event
3. **Shows details** including title, date, time, location, type, and description
4. **User can close** by clicking the × button or clicking outside

### Technical Implementation:
- **State Management**: `selectedEvent` and `eventDialogPosition` states
- **Click Handler**: `handleEventClick()` captures event data and position
- **Positioning**: Uses `getBoundingClientRect()` for accurate positioning
- **Outside Click**: Event listener to close dialog when clicking elsewhere

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Event Badge:
- **Hover Effect**: Shadow appears on hover
- **Cursor**: Changes to pointer on hover
- **Color Coding**: Maintains existing color scheme by event type

### Event Dialog:
- **Clean Design**: White background with subtle border
- **Shadow**: Drop shadow for depth
- **Icons**: Calendar, Clock, MapPin icons for visual clarity
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with title, details, and description
- **Responsive**: Max width with proper spacing
